<li class="fragment"><p>Additional adjustments to the average global surface temperature change are made such as accounting for heterogeneity to minimize local non-climatic effects.</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>The Washington Post addressed the tweet by identifying that the National Reviewer had scaled the plot to “hide the actual change in temperature.”</p></li>

<p>In the primary graph 19 MLS soccer teams and values spent on players salaries. The graph is broken down by several groups: players, players position. The full length of the bars suggest the total amount spent on players salaries. Individual bar can also be used to compare the relative amount invested on each player within a team. In the sub graph, the data is broken down by: players position and dollar amount spent.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Accessibility is the practice of ensuring that all individuals have equal access to resources, programs, and opportunities, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.</p>
<p>In more recent years, the study of colors in statistical visualizations has burgeoned since visualizations rely on color for many different reasons (e.g.&nbsp;distinction of classes, degrees,effects). Findings from those studies highlight several key themes that researchers need to consider while creating visualizations. For instance, an individuals degree of color blindness may influence the perception of graph or figure. One in every 12 men (8%) and one in every 200 women (0.5%) in the U.S. are born with inherited color defective vision of some type and degree (Johnson, 2024). The most common color-blindness types are red-green and blue-purple. Any color that contains the affected primary color is distorted.</p>
<p>Using neural networks, Petfroff (2024), was able to identify sequence of colors that may improve the accessibility of plots. Several variables were used as predictors/features: color blindness types, color lightness, preferred color sequence, and aesthetic preferences. Three color sequences were identified. All started with the color blue.</p>
<p>Different mediums play a considerable role in the perception of graphs, figures, and tables. Colors may be more saturated on a computer than a piece of paper. Different software may use different varying default colors in visual aides. A data scientist needs to consider their audience.</p>
